# Splunk-Universal-Forwarder-Install-Script-Windows


-Place this script in the same directory as the Splunk Universal Forwarder MSI installer.

-Run as Administrator.

#This script will install the Splunk Universal Forwarder Application, set the username as "SplunkAdmin", generate a random password, and configures the UF as deployment client. 

Note: You will need to set the IP address of the Deployment Server within the script (or remove that flag all together if not applicable) and ensure the filename of the MSI installer matches the file name referenced at the beginning of the script.
